Graphic examples of front-end applications I have produced

Please note that the images above are bespoke applications created to fulfil specific user requirements. Images are censored as necessary
to protect secure or otherwise identifying information.

All information displayed in these are real-time; whether obtained from web APIs, or the result of back-end systems (also developed by myself) which then produce an output to be shown in real-time.
